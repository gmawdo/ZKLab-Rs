# ZKLab-Rs

A laboratory for exploring Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) in Rust, from basic concepts to advanced implementations.

## 🔍 Purpose
This project provides hands-on examples and implementations to understand:
- Basic ZKP concepts
- Polynomial commitments
- Elliptic curve operations
- SNARKs and STARKs
- Practical ZKP applications

## 🚀 Learning Path
1. Basic arithmetic circuits
2. Polynomial operations
3. Elliptic curve fundamentals
4. Complete SNARK implementations
